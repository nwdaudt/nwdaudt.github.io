(en)  We report on three aberrantly plumaged White-chinned Petrels *Procellaria aequinoctialis* from the Brazilian EEZ in the south-west Atlantic Ocean. Two of them showed a low degree of colour aberration, whereas the third exhibited the highest degree of plumage aberration so far reported for the species. We also commented on problems related to at-sea identiﬁcation of aberrantly plumaged seabirds.

(pt-br)  Apresentamos três registros de pardela-preta *Procellaria aequinoctialis* com aberrações de plumagem no sul do Brasil, um deles considerado ser o maior grau de aberração de plumagem até então registrado para a espécie. Aproveitamos para discutir problemas relacionados à identificação desses indivíduos com plumagem aberrante registrados no mar.
