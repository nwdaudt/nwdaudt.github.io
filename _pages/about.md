Hi there,

People call me Nico, welcome to my website. 

I am a Brazilian **marine quantitative ecologist** working with marine top predators, particularly seabirds. My research interest lies in *community ecology*, *spatial ecology*, *trophic ecology*, and *marine pollution*. Specifically, I work with **biodiversity patterns** and the **distribution** of marine organisms and the impacts of **plastic pollution** on the environment. To achieve that, I use a series of data sources, such as on-board at-sea surveys, beach surveys (stranded animals), scientific collections, and more recently, I'm exploring open-access databases such as [OBIS](https://obis.org/) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) with some colleagues. 

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Marine Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/index.html) from the University of Otago. I have the spatial ecologist [Will Rayment](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/people/staff/willrayment.html), the physical oceanographer [Rob O. Smith](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/people/staff/otago664247.html) and the statistician [Matt Schofield](https://www.stats.otago.ac.nz/?people=matthew_schofield) as my main surpervisors. We also have on-board with us [Eric J. Woehler](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric-Woehler) and [Leandro Bugoni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leandro-Bugoni) as seabird specialists and project advisors.

I am working hard on learning and implement open-science principles, and on `[Resources]()` I share some links that have been helping me during this journey.

I work closely with [Laboratório de Aves Aquáticas e Tartarugas Marinhas - LAATM](https://laatm.furg.br/), Lab where I did my Master degree, and the Scientific Collection Sector from the [Museu de Ciências Naturais - MUCIN](https://www.ufrgs.br/mucin), where I am an Associated Researcher.
