excerpt: "In this paper we report fishermen off southern Brazil trying to reduce bait depredation in pole-and-line and handlining fisheries by hitting birds with a metal piece attached to a pole-and-line on four occasions. Fishermen also mutilated or killed birds caught alive on the lines (aggressive handling). In addition, we present a compilation of records of Procellariiformes with bill mutilations across the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Observations spanning 1999–2019 across the waters of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina totalize 46 Procellariiformes of eight species (four globally threatened) recorded with bill mutilations (29 alive and 17 dead). Mutilations were likely caused by aggressive handling of birds caught alive."

(pt-br)  Nesse trabalho documentamos práticas de manejo agressivo contra albatrozes e petréis no sul do Brasil. Com a justificativa de diminuir a depredação das íscas, os pescadores intencionalmente acertavam as aves com pedaços de metais amarrados em varas de pesca. Alguns pescadores também mataram intencionalmente aves vivas, fisgadas em anzóis sem intenção. Nós também documentamos 46 registros de albatrozes e petréis (vivos e mortos) com mutilações nos bicos. Apesar de contactarmos pesquisadores da vários países, os registros foram, somente, nos países do Brasil, Uruguai e Argentina. Das oito espécies registradas com mutilações, quatro estão em alguma categoria de ameaça de extinção. Essas mutilações foram, provavelmente, provenientes de manejos agressivos de pescadores contra as aves.
