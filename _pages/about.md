Hi there,

People call me Nico, welcome to my website. 

I am a Brazilian **marine quantitative ecologist** working with marine top predators, particularly seabirds. My research interest lies in *community ecology, spatial ecology*, and *marine pollution*. Specifically, I work with **biodiversity patterns** and the **distribution** of marine organisms and the impacts of **plastic pollution** on them and their environment. To achieve that, I use a series of data sources, such as on-board at-sea surveys, beach surveys (strandings), scientific collections, and more recently, I'm exploring open-access databases such as [OBIS](https://obis.org/) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) with some colleagues. 

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Marine Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/index.html) from the University of Otago. I have [Will Rayment](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/people/staff/willrayment.html) as my main supervisor, backing me up with spatial ecology expertise, and the physical oceanographer [Rob O. Smith](https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/people/staff/otago664247.html) and the statistician [Matt Schofield](https://www.stats.otago.ac.nz/?people=matthew_schofield). We also have on-board with us [Eric J. Woehler](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric-Woehler) and [Leandro Bugoni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leandro-Bugoni) as seabird specialists and project advisors.

I am working hard on learning and implement open-science principles, and on `[Resources]()` I share some links that have been helping me during this journey.
